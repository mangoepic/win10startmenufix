If your installation has the issue that sometimes pressing the windows button doesn't open the start menu.

There is a method to fix it by manually restarting windows file explorer but it it's easier to just insert a .bat file into your autostart that does it for you. It worked ever since! :)

## Installation

1. Open your Windows startup folder by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> enter `shell:startup` and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> or OK.
2. Download the `restartExplorer.bat` from this repository and insert it into the startup folder.
3. You should be good to go!
